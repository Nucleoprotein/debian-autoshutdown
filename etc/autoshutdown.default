# Script Common Configuration

ENABLE="true"
    # If the autoshutdown-script should be enabled or not. (default="true")
    #
    # Note: enabled/disabled does start the script on OMV, but then it checks,
    # if the script is enabled or disabled. If it is "disabled", then the
    # script stops with a log-message.

CYCLES=6
    # Set the number of cycles with no result (no PC online etc.) before
    # shutdown. (default=6) allowed is 1 - 999.

SLEEP=180
    # Numbers of seconds between each Cycle (Check). (default=180, 3 min)
    # allowed is 1 - 9999.

    # - Define by FQDN      : fqdn | iface@fqdn
    # If '<START>..<END>' or 'Last octet of IPv4' is set the first three octets
    # of the iface IPv4 address are used. If '0x<START>..0x<END>' or 'Last
    # hextet of IPv6' is set the first seven hextets of the iface IPv6 address
    # is used. Please make sure to leave 1 and 255 out of the IPv4 range!

ULDLCHECK="true"
    # Set it to "true" for a network-traffic check. (default="true")

ULDLRATE=50
    # Define the network traffic in kB/s in each cycle autoshutdown checks
    # whether the network-traffic (upload or download) is over the set value
    # over this value, no shutdown -> new check after x seconds (see SLEEP)

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

LOADAVERAGECHECK="true"
    # Set it to "true" for a check of load-average in  autoshutdown. If the

LOADAVERAGE=40
    # Set this to the target load-average for the Server. (default=40)
    # Make sure you leave the leading zeros and the dot out of the value!
    # Example:
    # LOADAVERAGE=50   # means a loadaverage of 0.50
    # LOADAVERAGE=8    # means a loadaverage of 0.08
    # LOADAVERAGE=220  # means a loadaverage of 2.20
    # and so on ...

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

HDDIOCHECK="true"
    # Set it to "true" for a check of HDD-IO over the last SLEEP-time in
    # autoshutdown. If the system is over this value, then no shutdown is
    # issued. (default="true")

HDDIO_RATE=401
    # If a HDD-IO (read/write) is over a defined value in kB/s (default=401)
    # and then don't shutdown the Server. This value is calculated with the
    # SLEEP-time between every cycle of the script-checks. e.g.: You have
    # defined HDDIO_RATE=2000 and the script sleep for 100 second then the
    # HDD-IO (read or write) has to be over 200000kB (2000*100) within the last
    # 100 sec to not shutdown the server.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

SMARTCHECK="false"
    # Do a HDD check to see if S.M.A.R.T tests are running and if they are
    # running block shutdown. Note this will only work if smart is supported
    # directly. For example this will not work with a HPE smart array.
    # (default="false")

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHECK_SAMBA="true"
    # If set to "true", smbstatus will be checked for connected clients.
    # (default="true")

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHECK_CLI="true"
    # If set to "true", will check for connected users. (default="true")

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHECKPROCNAMES="true"
    # If set to "true", will enable LOADPROCNAMES and TEMPPROCNAMES checks.
    # (default="true")

LOADPROCNAMES="smbd,nfsd,mt-daapd,forked-daapd"
    # Command names of processes with load dependent children checked.
    # To disable the load process check set LOADPROCNAMES="-". (default="
    # proftpd,smbd,nfsd,mt-daapd,forked-daapd")

TEMPPROCNAMES="in.tftpd"
    # Command names of processes only started when active checked with "top"
    # AND "ps", so all processes are found, even such, which doesn't show up in
    # top like "lftp". Beware: If the process shows up in "ps" when there is no
    # connection, your PC won't shutdown! Maybe you have to  call the process
    # in you script like this: "lftp -do -something -here && exit" so that the
    # process is killed after it has done something checked. To disable the
    # temp process check set to TEMPPROCNAMES="-". (default="in.tftpd")

    # The following scheme is mandatory for both LOADPROCNAMES and
    # TEMPPROCNAMES: process1,process2, all processes separated by comma ','.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

PLUGINCHECK="false"
    # PlugIns: You find sample plugins in /etc/autoshutdown.d. Set this to
    # "true", if autoshutdown checks for PlugIns in /etc/autoshutdown.d set it
    # to "false" to skip the check. (default="false")
    #
    # E.g.: When ClamAV does a check, the Server shouldn't shut down. How to do
    # that?  Let's look at a example: in the clamav-plugin for autoshutdown
    # (etc/autoshutdown.d/clamav) the following is set:
    #
    #    # In which folder is the file to look for
    #    folder="/var/run/clamav"
    #    # Enable or disable this plugin.
    #    enabled="true"
    #    # Filename (can be expanded with regexes)
    #    file="clamdscan-[a-f0-9]{8}-[a-f0-9]{4}-[a-f0-9]{4}-[a-f0-9]{4}-[a-f0-9]{12}"
    #
    # Then, if a file i.e.: clamdscan-aaaa3556-adfe-5678-abcdef012345
    # (or whatever UUID) in /var/run/clamav exists, the Server isn't shutdown.
    #
    # Also possible:
    #
    #     folder="/home/user"
    #     enabled="true or false"
    #     file="backup.status"
    #     content="processing job"
    #
    # If a file /home/user/backup.status exists with the content 'processing
    # job', the Server isn't shutdown. This is useful for backup-scripts. It
    # is not nice if the PC is shutting down while the backup-script is
    # running. In my backup-script I use a simple.
    #
    #     echo "processing job" > /home/user/backup.status
    #
    # At the beginning and a
    #
    #     rm /home/user/backup.status
    #
    # At the end of the script. In the boot-Phase also a
    #
    #     rm /home/user/*.status
    #
    # To delete all *.status files, which are not deleted before (loss of power
    # for example).

# Syslog Configuration

SYSLOG="true"

    # This setting can also be used to optimise script start-up time so that
